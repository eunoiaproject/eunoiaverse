## Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

Configure your database connection in `service/database.php`:

```php
<?php
$hostname = "localhost";
$user_name = "root";
$user_password = "your_password";
$database_name = "eunoiaverse_db";
?>
```

### 2. Authentication

Check the `auth.js` file for login/register logic:

```javascript
// Verify user session
if (localStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn') !== 'true') {
    window.location.href = "login.html";
}
```

### 3. Using the Marketplace

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/marketplace.css">
<script src="assets/js/marketplace.js"></script>
```
